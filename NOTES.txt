Is Expr too restrictive?
Should we allow "Op" which is a wrapper around the thing?

Specifically, for lists and tuples: it's safe to decompose them as long as you
don't try to set the name or whatever.

Op [Expr (Tensor a)]


No, what we really want is one of the following:

[Expr t]
(OpDef -> OpDef) -> [Expr t]
etc.

ACTUALLY, this is kinda nice for tuples too!

(Expr t1, Expr t2)

:)

Of course, this means that every op is rendered for every list element.
But we can use observable sharing to get around that.
OK, just need to figure out a good API...

Yes, this makes more sense than before.  It makes a stronger case for
Expr vs Build.
